In this project, I created 4 user defined functions and BeautifulSoup that scrape search enginges such as google to bring you data about any city that the user can input

Here is the code from our Utilities file (file with the functions)


import bs4
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import time


#gets time, temperature, and sky of city input from google search
def weather (city):
    url = "https://www.google.com/search?q="+"weather"+city
    response = requests.get(url)
    html_doc = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "lxml")
    temp = soup.find('div', attrs={'class': 'BNeawe iBp4i AP7Wnd'}).text
    info = soup.find('div', attrs={'class': 'BNeawe tAd8D AP7Wnd'}).text
    data = info.split('\n')
    time = data[0]
    sky = data[1]
    
    print("\nTime:", time, )
    print("Temperature is currently ", temp,)
    print("Sky Description: ", sky, '\n')

#gets air quality data of city input  from wunderground
def airquality(city): 
   url='https://www.wunderground.com/health/us/ia/'+city 
   request_result = requests.get( url )
   soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup( request_result.text
						, "html.parser" )
   AQI = soup.find( "div" , class_='aqi-value' ).text
   status = soup.find( "div" , class_='aqi-type' ).text
   time.sleep(1)
   print('Air Quality:', AQI)
   print('Live AQI Index: ', status, 'Air Quality\n')

# Gets population of city input from google
def city_population (city):
    url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q='+'population'+city
    response = requests.get(url)
    html_doc = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "html.parser")
    population = soup.find('div', attrs={'class': 'BNeawe iBp4i AP7Wnd'}).text
    print('Population of', city, ':', population)

    
# gets average age of city input from google search
def average_age (city):
    url = "https://www.google.com/search?q="+"average age in "+city
    response = requests.get(url)
    html_doc = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "lxml")
    avg_age = soup.find('div', attrs={'class': 'BNeawe iBp4i AP7Wnd'}).text
    time.sleep(1)
    print('\nAverage age in', city, ':' , avg_age)
    
 We used a different file called main to call these functions and print the results, here is the code for that file 

import Utilities

city = str(input('City, State : '))

Utilities.weather(city)
Utilities.airquality(city)
Utilities.city_population(city)
Utilities.average_age(city)

The output of this code gives you the following data from whichever city and state you input (e.g. 'Iowa City, Iowa')

Time
Temperature
Sky Description

Air Quality
Air Quality Index

Population

Average age
