--This is a dice game with the following question to be answered: 
-Roll a six sided die.
-If you roll a 1, 2 or a 3, the game is over.
-If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you win that many dollars ($4, $5, or $6), and then roll again.
- With each additional roll, you have the chance to win more money, or you might roll a game-ending 1, 2, 
or 3, at which time the game is over and you keep whatever winnings you have accumulated.

Would you pay $3 for a chance to play this game? Why or why not?

â€¢	We would pay $3 to play this game, because the average outcomes of the game are more than $3, so you are more than likely going to make your money back.
